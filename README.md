## What Is Cryptography?
"Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries."

## Encryption Algorithms
"Cryptography is broadly classified into two categories: Symmetric key Cryptography and Asymmetric key Cryptography (popularly known as public key cryptography)."

## Symmetric Key Cryptography
"An encryption system in which the sender and receiver of a message share a single, common key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. The most popular symmetric–key system is the Data Encryption Standard (DES)"

## Substitution Cipher
"Method of encryption by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the “units” may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth"

## Stream Cipher
"Symmetric or secret-key encryption algorithm that encrypts a single bit at a time. With a Stream Cipher, the same plaintext bit or byte will encrypt to a different bit or byte every time it is encrypted."

## Block Cipher
"An encryption method that applies a deterministic algorithm along with a symmetric key to encrypt a block of text, rather than encrypting one bit at a time as in stream ciphers"

## Asymmetric Key Encryption (or Public Key Cryptography)
"The encryption process where different keys are used for encrypting and decrypting the information. Keys are different but are mathematically related, such that retrieving the plain text by decrypting ciphertext is feasible."

## RSA Algorithm
RSA stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman, inventors of this technique
Both public and private key are interchangeable
Variable Key Size (512, 1024, or 2048 bits)
